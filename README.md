# This is the version live on the web at [GreenStand.org](https://www.greenstand.org)

###The code for the website is to be found in the /dist directory
**reasons for choosing angular for such a simple website**
* I wanted to!
* More seriously, the website will very likely grow a bit and it will be easy to add features with angular
    * other branches of this repo already have some other features check them out if you like.

**to check the project out**
1. Install node and npm
1. Install [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
1. clone the repo
1. run `npm install` in the console
1. run `ng serve` and open a window in your browser at localhost:4200
1. Oh yeah, make sure you have a code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)
1. start coding and see what happens!
